# Numpy-library
## NumPy Concepts Project
##### The goal of the project:

To measure the understanding and practical application of core concepts in the NumPy library using various array operations.

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a wide range of NumPy functionalities through practical examples. It includes creating, reshaping, modifying, merging, and splitting arrays of different dimensions, as well as exploring their properties and data types.
Through these exercises, the project aims to strengthen understanding of how NumPy efficiently handles multi-dimensional data structures.
## Key Features
Create 1D, 3D, and 4D arrays using numpy.array() and linspace()

Display array properties: type, shape, size, and dimensions

Change array data types (for example, float to integer)

Iterate through array elements using nditer()

Access specific elements by index
Search for values using where()

Reshape arrays to different dimensions

Merge and split arrays with or without specifying axis

## Technologies Used
Python
